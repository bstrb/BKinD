
- Add CBI to LTA to prepare for merging several experiments
	# Gaussian fit to find CB spot
	# Correct normalization of intensities
	# Add CBI to XDS_ASCII and keep duplicate reflections across XDS_ASCII files with highest CBI
	# Merge using XSCALE
	# Prepare for SHELXL refinement using XDSCONV
	# Refine and compare results to a merging without removing duplicate reflections
 
- Apply Machine Learning to identify dynamical effects:
	# Center Beam Intensity
	# SNR
	# Validate Prediction using SHELXL refinement
	- Resolution
	- Systematic Row
	- Sayre Equation

- SSED Project
	# Reduce h5 files GUI
	# Generate bash file GUI for fast integration
	# Automize FI
	# Studied and optimized data need for fast integration (about 5000 indexed frames needed for clear trends in refinement)
	# Assess RMSD for strongest peaks as a metric for index quality (statistically OK but not clearly optimizeable)
	# New metric for index quality using exponentially weighted normalized product of metrics incorporating intensity weighted RMSD, cell parameter deviations, numberg of peaks and indexed reflections and profile radius
	# Fit exponential to Chunked Curve
	# Convert HDF5 images from 16bit integer to 32bit float
	# Nonindexed frames
	# Distribuion of orientation matrices
	# EMP vs RCIS_v1
	# PhD application
	# Use retry when indexing
	# Re-run peakfinding before indexing
	# Removal of ice rings before indexing
	# Radial background removal
	# Erice EC course
	- xGandalf algorithm for ED (prev xray)
	- Fine tune IQM
	- Workflow PDF
	- Merging h5 files
	- Which frames are removed by CC1/2 rejection
	- New workflow:
		- Intensity based CF, removal of bad frames and background
		- PF using pf8 or pf9
		- Indexing with high xGandalf tolerance
		- Refine center using index results
		- Re-index with refined center

	# BKinD presentation
	- Filter to certain R value
	- CAPS all XDS files
	- Check .ins lines
	- open_plot and open_folder etc.
	- R1[all data]
	- Remember earlier projects
