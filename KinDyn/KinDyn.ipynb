    "### **KinDyn Project Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**  \n",
    "The **KinDyn** project involved filtering 3DED (Three-Dimensional Electron Diffraction) data using a developed filtering program called **BKinD** to refine the dataset based on an equation called the **Deviation from Model (DFM)**. This filtering was performed iteratively until a desired level of completeness was achieved in the dataset, with the goal of analyzing how the filtering process affected key crystallographic metrics and structure determination outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DFM Equation:**  \n",
    "The DFM for each reflection was calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "DFM = \\frac{F_o^2 - F_c^2}{\\sqrt{(\\sigma_{F_o^2})^2 + (2 \\cdot u \\cdot F_c^2)^2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $F_o^2$ is the squared observed structure factor,\n",
    "- $F_c^2$ is the squared calculated structure factor,\n",
    "- $\\sigma_{F_o^2}$ is the uncertainty in the observed structure factor,\n",
    "- $u$ is a scaling factor that adjusts the influence of the calculated structure factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DFM equation is inspired by a weighting scheme discussed on page 221 of the **JANA98 Software Manual**. This weighting scheme helps account for uncertainties in both the observed and calculated structure factors, ensuring that larger uncertainties reduce the contribution of those reflections to the overall dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instability factor $u$ was optimized during the process so that the DFM distribution had a **mean** equal to the **median**, ensuring a balanced distribution of deviations. This optimization aimed to minimize bias in the data by adjusting $u$ such that the central tendency of the DFM values was symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filtering process progressively removed reflections with high DFM values, under the assumption that these reflections diverged significantly from the expected model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Filtering Process and Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of the project was to understand how DFM filtering affected key metrics used in crystallographic analysis, such as:\n",
    "- **R1 and Rint values**: Metrics that indicate the quality of the fit between the observed and calculated structure factors.\n",
    "- **Structure Solvability**: The ability to solve the crystal structure based on the filtered dataset.\n",
    "- **Atomic Displacement Parameters (ADPs)**: Effect on atomic motion within the crystal.\n",
    "- **Resolution**: The level of detail in the resulting crystal structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the **removed data** (high DFM reflections) and the **remaining data** (after filtering) were analyzed at various stages of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Impact of Filtering on Crystallographic Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **R1 and Rint Values:**\n",
    "   - R1 and Rint values were calculated after each filtering step to observe how the removal of high-DFM reflections impacted the overall fit between observed and calculated structure factors.\n",
    "   - The goal was to assess whether the removal of these reflections improved the quality of the remaining data, as indicated by a reduction in R1 and Rint values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Structure Solvability:**\n",
    "   - Structure solvability was evaluated for both the removed and remaining data after each filtering step. The key focus was on when the structure could be solved using the **removed data**, which indicated that critical reflections were being discarded.\n",
    "   - When the structure could be solved from the removed data, it indicated that filtering had gone too far, as important reflections had been eliminated. This served as a signal that further filtering was no longer justifiable, since removing reflections that still contribute to structure solution undermines the validity of the filtering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Atomic Displacement Parameters (ADPs) – Removed Data Focus:**\n",
    "   - ADP positions, obtained through refinement using the correct structure, stabilized progressively with **successive filtering** of the **removed data**. This stabilization served as a **proxy** for structure solvability without the need to explicitly solve the structure using SHELXT and SHELXLE.\n",
    "   - The stabilization of ADP positions in the removed data indicated that critical reflections were being discarded, signaling that further filtering might lead to a loss of important structural information and should be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Resolution:**\n",
    "   - The effect of filtering on resolution was also evaluated, with the goal of determining if certain filtering steps led to a loss of high-resolution data or compromised the overall clarity of the structure.\n",
    "   - Any shifts in the resolution limit were documented to understand the trade-off between filtering and data completeness, ensuring that high-quality, high-resolution data was retained as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Analysis of DFM Across Reflections and Frames**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **DFM vs. Frame:**\n",
    "   - The DFM was calculated for each reflection across multiple frames of data collection. By tracking the DFM across frames, it was possible to determine if certain frames consistently produced higher deviations, potentially indicating areas of poorer data quality.\n",
    "   - This frame-by-frame analysis provided insights into how the quality of data varied during the experiment and guided decisions on which data to retain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **DFM Distribution:**\n",
    "   - The distribution of DFM values was examined to understand the overall spread of deviations within the dataset. This helped in identifying outliers and assessing the impact of filtering on the remaining reflections.\n",
    "   - A comparison of DFM distributions before and after filtering highlighted how the data quality improved, as the dataset became progressively \"cleaner\" with fewer high-DFM reflections.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### **Conclusion and Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "The filtering of 3DED data using the DFM equation had several key effects on crystallographic analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **R1 and Rint values:** As expected, **R1 and Rint values decreased** with filtering, particularly when the dataset had sufficient initial completeness and multiplicity. This decrease occurred because reflections that deviated significantly from the model were progressively removed, improving the overall fit. However, this improvement depended on maintaining enough data to avoid over-filtering and losing too many reflections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structure solvability (removed data):** While filtering did not noticeably improve the **structure solvability** of the remaining data, it revealed an important insight when examining the **removed data**. When the structure could be solved using the removed data, it indicated that critical reflections had been discarded. This provided a clear signal that filtering had gone too far, and further filtering was no longer justifiable. The ability to solve the structure from the removed data became a key criterion for assessing the appropriateness of the filtering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ADPs as a proxy for structure solvability:** The stabilization of ADP positions in the **removed data** served as a proxy for tracking structure solvability without having to solve the structure at each filtering step. As filtering progressed, ADP stabilization marked the point at which important reflections were being removed, signaling that further filtering could compromise the dataset’s integrity. This allowed for efficient tracking of filtering effects without repeated structure solution attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resolution impact:** The filtering process predominantly removed **low-resolution reflections** (higher Å), meaning that as filtering advanced, higher-resolution data was generally retained. However, aggressive filtering could still lead to the removal of essential reflections, impacting the dataset's completeness and the overall quality of the final structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project demonstrated that the DFM filtering method was effective in refining the dataset by removing reflections that deviated from the model. However, careful control was required to avoid discarding critical reflections, particularly those necessary for structure solution. The stabilization of ADP positions in the removed data provided a valuable tool for determining when further filtering was no longer appropriate. Future work could focus on refining the filtering process to optimize data retention while improving overall data quality.\n",

    "### SCXRD Filtering and Comparison with 3DED Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the **KinDyn** project, a version of the filtering program **BKind** was developed for **SCXRD data**. This version is also applicable to merged **3DED data**, allowing for a comparison between SCXRD and 3DED results. The comparison provides insights into how filtering affects different types of diffraction data and the impact on key crystallographic metrics.\n",
